==================================
Creating a new Patternslib pattern
==================================

--------------------
The directory outlay
--------------------

Each pattern should have a certain layout. Look for example at [pat-redactor](https://github.com/Patternslib/pat-redactor).

There are two folders, *demo* and *src*.

*demo* contains the files necessary to create a demonstration of the pattern as
well as some usage documentation in *documentation.md*.

The *src* folder contains the pattern's actual Javascript source file(s).


-------------------------------------------
Determining the HTML markup for the pattern
-------------------------------------------

Please refer to the official Patternslib documentation:

https://github.com/Patternslib/Patterns/blob/master/docs/api/parameters.rst

--------------------------------
Writing the pattern's javascript
--------------------------------

Please refer to the official Patternslib documentation:

https://github.com/Patternslib/Patterns/blob/master/docs/create-a-pattern.md

-------------------------------
Hook the pattern into our build
-------------------------------

In order to have your pattern available in Plone Intranet it needs to be
installable via bower and hooked up into the build.


Using bower to make the pattern installable
===========================================

We use [bower](http://bower.io) for mananging our front-end Javascript
dependencies.

The [bower.json](https://github.com/ploneintranet/ploneintranet.theme/blob/master/bower.json)
file which states these dependencies is inside [ploneintranet.theme](https://github.com/ploneintranet/ploneintranet.theme)

To update this file with your new pattern, you first need to register your
pattern in bower (you'll need the pattern's repository URL)::

    bower register pat-example git@github.com:ploneintranet/pat-example.git

Then you install the pattern with bower, stating the ``--save`` option so that
the ``bower.json`` file gets updated::

    bower install --save pat-example

The ``bower.json`` file will now be updated to include your new pattern and
your pattern will be available in ``./src/bower_components/``.

.. note: ProTip: Bower's checkouts of packages do not include version control.
    In order to use git inside a package checked out by bower, use "bower
    link". See here: http://bower.io/docs/api/#link


Tell r.js and require.js where your pattern is located
======================================================

Now, once we have the package registered and checked out by bower, we can
specify the pattern's path, so that [r.js](http://requirejs.org/docs/optimization.html)
(the tool that creates our final JS bundle) will now where it's located.

You want to modify
[build.js](https://github.com/ploneintranet/ploneintranet.theme/blob/master/build.js) inside
[ploneintranet.theme](https://github.com/ploneintranet/ploneintranet.theme) and
in the ``paths`` section add your package and its path.

We then also need to tell ``require.js`` that we actually want to use this
new pattern as part of our collection of patterns in the site.

You do that by editing [./src/patterns.js](https://github.com/ploneintranet/ploneintranet.theme/blob/master/src/patterns.js)
and adding the new pattern there.

.. note: ./src/patterns.js serves also as a handy references as to which
    patterns are actually included in the site.


Generate a new bundle file
==========================

Once this is all done, you run ``make bundle`` and the new Javascript bundle
will contain your newly created pattern.
